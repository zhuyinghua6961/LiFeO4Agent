The charge/discharge profiles in Figure 6b,c demonstrate that the Li-Ag@Cu//LFP cell exhibits less polarization than the Li-Cu//LFP cell, which is well in agreement with the cyclic performances obtained with symmetrical cells. The Ag plumes reduce the Li deposition overpotential of Cu, accelerating Li depositing/stripping kinetics on Cu, 59 which can be confirmed by the lower interface resistance of the cell with Li–Ag@Cu anode than that of the cell with Li–Cu anode in Figure 6d,e",

This excellent performance of the as-prepared Li-lean anode outperforms those that have been reported in literature, which should be attributed to the low Li deposition overpotential of Ag and the 3D Ag plume structure that provides large surface area for Li/ depositing/stripping and large space for alleviating the volume change of anode during cycling. Since its preparation is facile and easy to scale up, the as-developed anode is promising for the practical application of lithium-metal batteries.",

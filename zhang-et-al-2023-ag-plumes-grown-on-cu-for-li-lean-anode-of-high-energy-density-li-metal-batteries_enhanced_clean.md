Dehui Zhang, Zhiyong Xia, Zihao Li, Huirong Wang, Gaige Zhang, Zhaozhao He, Hebing Zhou, Mengqing Xu, Xiaoming Wei, and Weishan Li\* Cite This: ACS Appl. Energy Mater. 2023, 6, 6338-6347 **ACCESS** III Metrics & More sı Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Li metal combines the advantages of low redox potential and high theoretical specific capacity, being an ideal candidate anode for high energy density secondary batteries. However, Li-metal anode tends to grow dendrites that are highly reactive to electrolyte and cause issues such as fast capacity decaying and safety risk. To address these issues, we propose a Li-lean anode featuring Ag plumes on Cu substrate. The Ag plumes are grown on Cu substrate by immersing Cu foil in AgF aqueous solution, and the Li-lean anode is fabricated by depositing Li on the grown Ag plumes. Thanks to the large specific surface area and the low Li depositing/stripping overpotential of the Ag plumes, the as-fabricated Li-lean anode allows the cell to match with LiFePO4 cathode with excellent cyclic stability. Compared with the bare Cu electrode, the as-fabricated Li-lean anode improves the capacity retention of the cell with a LFP loading of  $0.4 \text{ mAh cm}^{-2}$  from 9 to 81% after 300 cycles at 1 C between 2.0 and 4. V. The facile formation of Ag plumes makes it possible for high energy density Li-metal batteries to be applied in a large scale.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

High energy density rechargeable batteries are urgently needed to meet the requirements of electricity-driving devices for sizes to be as compact and for working time to be as long as possible. Li-ion batteries based on graphite anode provide the highest energy density among currently commercialized rechargeable batteries but cannot match the requirements above. Therefore, searching for the substitutes for graphite has attracted much attention. Li metal is an ideal candidate for replacing graphite because it has the lowest potential (-3.04)V) and high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g-1). However, its active chemical property makes it difficult to be used in practice. On one hand, due to the direct contact of lithium with the organic electrolytes, the uncontrolled interface reactions between the electrolytes and the lithium metal lead to the loss of active lithium, the depletion of the electrolyte, and the accumulation of reaction products, 13 which are responsible for the increase in interface impedance of anode/ electrolyte and the fast capacity decaying of Li-metal batteries. On the other hand, the uneven Li depositing during cycling generates Li dendrites on the surface of the anode, which might not only penetrate the separator causing a short circuit of the cell but also be fractured increasing the volume of the anode. To address these issues, various strategies have been proposed, including (1) developing new electrolyte formula that can accommodate the high activity of Li and reduce side reactions on the anode; 21-26 (2) designing anode structures and compositions or modifying anode surface with other metals or compounds that present low Li depositing/stripping overpotential; 27-35 (3) modifying separator to guide a uniform Li+ flow and mitigate dendrite growth. Among these strategies, modifying the anode surface with other metals or compounds is the most direct and practical approach. However, most reported modifications in literature were performed on Li-metal anode, which reduces the energy density of the batteries when Li-containing cathodes are used. Correspondingly, Li-lean anodes were developed by using electronically conductive materials such as carbon and Cu as substrates 46,47 and Ag was used to lower Li depositing/ stripping overpotential. Zhang et al. synthesized controllable lithiophilic Ag particles by directly plating Ag on the carbon fiber frame, injecting molten Li and obtaining a coral-shaped Ag-plated carbon fiber-based composite Li anode. Yang et al. prepared ultrafine Ag nanoparticles that were uniformly anchored to carbon nanofibers. Unfortunately, these processes for introducing Ag particles are complex and unsuitable for the Li-lean anode to be used in practice.

In this work, we report a novel Li-lean anode that can be facilely fabricated and enables Li-metal batteries with excellent cyclic stability. Ag plumes are self-assembled on Cu foil by simply immersing Cu foil in AgF aqueous solution, resulting in an Ag@Cu substrate. The Li-lean anode is fabricated by depositing a small amount of Li on the Ag@Cu substrate. The Ag plumes exhibit a large specific surface area, providing the anode with abundant active sites for Li depositing/stripping and ensuring the anode with low Li depositing/stripping overpolarization and excellent cyclic stability when matched with Li-containing cathodes.

## 2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

**2.1. Electrode Preparation.** Cu foil was cut into disks with a diameter of 12 mm, ultrasonically cleaned in absolute ethanol, treated in 1 M H2SO4 solution for 24 h, and rinsed with deionized water. The treated Cu disks were stored in absolute ethanol. Ag plumes were grown by immersing the treated Cu disks in 1 wt % AgF aqueous solution for 2 min, rinsed with deionized water, and dried to obtain Cu disks grown with Ag plumes, denoted as Ag@Cu. Li-lean anode was prepared by electrodepositing 10 mAh cm-2 Li on Ag@Cu in Li//Ag@Cu cells, denoted as Li-Ag@Cu. An electrode with the same content of Li was prepared by depositing Li directly on bare Cu disks (denoted as Li–Cu) for comparison. LiFePO $_4$  (LFP) cathode was prepared by mixing 80% LFP, 10% acetylene black, and 10% polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) in weight in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), coating the slurry coated onto aluminum foil, drying overnight at 120  $^{\circ}$ C, and cutting into disks with a diameter of 12 mm.

2.2. Cells Assembly and Electrochemical Test. Ethylene carbonate (EC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) were provided by Guangzhou Tinci Material Technology Co., Ltd., China. M LiPF6 dissolving in a mixed solvent of EC and EMC with a mass ratio of 1:1 was used as the electrolyte. Bare Cu//Li and Ag@Cu//Li cells were assembled to evaluate the Li depositing behavior on Cu and Ag@Cu substrates, respectively. Li–Cu and Li–Ag@Cu symmetrical cells were assembled to evaluate the Li depositing/stripping behaviors. Li–Cu//LiFePO4 (LFP) and Li–Ag@Cu//LFP cells were assembled to evaluate cyclic stability of the anodes in full cells, with LFP mass loading of 0.4 mAh cm-2 and 1.0 mAh cm-2 and corresponding N/P ratio of 25 and 10, respectively. All the cells above were CR2025 coin cells and assembled in an argon-filled glovebox using a polyethylene separator (Celgard 2400) and 50  $\mu$ L.

All the electrochemical tests were performed at 25 °C using the LAND test system (Land CT2001 A, China). The cyclic stability of aforementioned symmetrical cells was tested at a current density of 0.5 or 1 mA cm-2 and a capacity of 0.5 or 1 mAh cm-2. The cyclic stability of Li–Cu//LFP and Li–Ag@Cu//LFP full cells was tested Figure 2.

between 2.0 and 4. V under 0. C (1 C = 170 mA  $g^{-1}$ ) for the first three cycles and 1 or 2 C for the subsequent cycles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on an electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT-30, Autolab Metrohm, The Netherlands) with a frequency range of  $10^5-10^{-2}$  Hz and an amplitude of 5 mV.

**2.3.** Physical Characterization. A series of physical characterizations were performed on the Ag@Cu and Li-Ag@Cu electrodes before and after cyclic testing. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advanced, Germany) was used to characterize the crystal structure of the substrates. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 250 FEG, USA) was used to obtain the surface morphology of the electrodes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, USA) was used to identify the Ag plumes grown on Cu substrate.

#### 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

**3.1. Physical Features of Ag@Cu Substrate.** The resultant Ag@Cu substrate was performed with XRD characterization. The obtained results are presented in Figure 1a. Four distinct characteristic peaks between 30° and 80° for metal Ag (PDF#04-0783) can be identified on Ag@Cu substrate, suggesting that Ag has been grown on Cu foil that has characteristic peaks at 43.3°, 50.4°, and 74.1°, corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal faces of Cu foil (PDF no. 04-0836). As shown in Figure S1, the Cu foil for growing Ag presents a flat and smooth surface. When Cu foils are immersed in the AgF-containing aqueous solution, Ag starts to grow with a plume-like morphology, which selfassembles layer by layer on Cu foil, forming a 3D structure, as demonstrated by the SEM images in Figure S2. This unique morphology has never been reported before. The 3D structure presents larger surface areas and contains more free space, therefore not only providing abundant active sides for Li depositing/stripping but also being able to buffer volume change of Li anode, which is the biggest challenge for the practical application of Li-metal batteries. It can be found from Figure S2 that the plume morphology is not completely formed when the AgF content in the aqueous solution for growing Ag is low (Figure S2a) and tends to disappear when increasing AgF contents (Figure S2c,d). The effect of immersion time is similar to that of AgF content. Sufficient Figure 4. Morphological evolution of Li deposition on Ag@Cu electrode.

time is needed for forming a good Ag plume structure, while immersing for too long will cause damage to the Ag plumes structure. To ensure the Ag@Cu substrate with a specific surface as large as possible, the substrate prepared using an aqueous solution with 1% AgF (Figure 1b,c) was used for further investigations. The plume (Figure 1d) contains Ag, Cu, and F, as indicated by HAADF-STEM results (Figure 1e-i). The Ag results from the displacement reaction between metal Cu on the Cu foil and Ag+ in the solution, which is in the form of Ag metal, as identified by using HRTEM to observe the plume surface (Figure 1j). The lattice spacing of 0.242 nm corresponds to the (101) crystal plane of Ag (Figure 1k). The Cu and F come from the combination of Cu2+ resulting from the displacement reaction with F-in the solution. The lattice spacing of 0.227 nm belongs to the (111) crystal plane of AgCuF3 (Figure 1l,m).

Based on the physical characterizations above and the chemical natures of Cu and Ag, the formation processes of Ag plumes can be illustrated in Figure 2. As soon as the Cu foil makes contact with the AgF aqueous solution, the displacement reaction takes place due to the electrode potential difference between Cu dissolution and Ag+ reduction, which is accompanied by the Ag nucleation on Cu foil and Cu2+ dissolution into solution (Figure 2a). The nucleated Ag will grow according to the crystal lattice (Figure 2b), while the dissolved Cu2+ tends to combine Ag+ and F-in the solution, forming indissoluble AgCuF3, which inhibits the growth of Ag in certain directions. The synergy between the two reactions results in a stable plume-like morphology. When the Cu foil is covered with a layer of Ag flumes, new layers of Ag flumes will be formed on the previous layers, forming an Ag@Cu substrate with 3D structure (Figure 2c).

Because of the low overpotential of Ag for lithium deposition and the large surface area of the 3D structure to accommodate electrode volume change during cycling, the Ag@Cu substrate exhibits more uniform Li deposition than the bare Cu, as shown in Figure 3a. Figure 3b presents the potential evolution of bare Cu and Ag@Cu electrodes during Li deposition at 1 mA cm-2, which includes nucleation (sharp dropping) and growth processes (slow recovering and reaching stable value). During the Li nucleation, the potential of bare Cu and Ag@Cu drops to -427 and -103 mV (vs Li/Li+), respectively, indicating that Ag@Cu has a far lower overpotential for Li nucleation than bare Cu. As the electrodes are covered completely with the previously deposited Li, both electrodes exhibit almost the same potential of -62 mV (vs Li/ Li+) for the subsequent Li deposition. Therefore, the nucleation overpotentials of bare Cu and Ag@Cu electrodes are -365 and -41 mV, respectively. Such a low Li nucleation of Ag@Cu can be ascribed to the formation of LixAgy alloy. So The Li nucleation overpotential increases as the current density increases (Figure 3c), but this negative effect is not so significant for Ag@Cu electrode as bare Cu electrode (Figure 3d).

The morphological evolution of Ag@Cu under different Li deposition contents (Figure 4a) was obtained by using SEM observation. As can be seen in Figure 4b, when the Li deposition is 2 mAh cm-2, the deposition takes place on the Ag plumes. As the Li deposition reaches 4 mAh cm-2, the deposited Li fills the empty space among Ag plumes that is still identifiable in Figure 4c. After the Li deposition approaches 6 mAh cm-2, the Ag plumes are completely invisible with lumps of Li fully covering them (Figure 4d). When the deposition of Li reaches 8 mAh cm-2, the deposited Li shows a smooth Figure 5. Voltage profiles of Li depositing/stripping in symmetric cells with Li-Cu and Li-Ag@Cu electrodes at (a) 1 mA cm-2 for 1 mAh cm-2 and (b) 0.5 mA cm-2 for 0.5 mAh cm-2.

surface without any dendrites (Figure 4e). These results demonstrate that the 3D Ag plume structure of Ag@Cu has the ability to accommodate the volume change of the electrode and suppresses the dendrite growth of Li. To illustrate that the deposition process of Li occurs at the surface of Ag plumes, we performed an EDS on the Ag@Cu by depositing 2 mAh cm-2 of Li. As shown in Figure 4f—i, the Ag, Cu, and F can still be identified on the electrode with deposited Li, indicating that the Li deposition takes place evenly on the surface of Ag plumes in Ag@Cu electrode, which exhibits low Li deposition overpotential.

The formation process of lithium on bare Cu and Ag@Cu electrode can be better understood in Figure S3. Li deposits at the tips on the bare Cu substrate, yielding dendritic and mossy Li, while Li is homogeneously nucleated on Ag@Cu substrate, ensuring uniform Li deposition. The morphology of Li deposition on bare Cu and Ag@Cu electrodes was compared by SEM observation, and the obtained results are presented in Figure S4. Initially, the fresh bare Cu electrode is clean and smooth (Figure S4a) but shows an uneven lithium deposition after depositing 0.2 mAh cm-2 Li (Figure S4b), while the plume-like morphology of Ag@Cu can still be seen (Figure S4e) and there is no obvious change from fresh Ag@Cu electrode (Figure S4d). After the deposited Li reaches 1 mAh cm-2, the moss-like Li scatters on the surface of the bare Cu (Figure S4c), while there is still no obvious surface change for the Ag@Cu (Figure S4e) except that the gap among Ag plumes is reduced compared with the fresh ones (Figure S4d). The cross-sectional SEM images (Figure S5) also confirm the different Li deposition on bare Cu from the 3D Ag plume structure of Ag@Cu. The Li deposition takes place on the surface of bare Cu, developing a rough and uneven surface (Figure S5a,c), which will develop into Li dendrites. In contrast, Li deposits preferentially on the surface of Ag plumes and then grows in the space among Ag plumes, ensuring a smooth Li deposition (Figure S5b,d). Due to the 3D structure of Ag plumes on Ag@Cu, sufficient Ag surface is available for Li deposition, which will ensure stable Li depositing/stripping **3.2. Cyclic Stability of Li-Lean Ag@Cu Anode.** Li-lean anodes were prepared by depositing 10 mAh cm-2 on Cu and Ag@Cu substrates under a current density of 1 mA cm-2 and Figure 7. Rate performance of Li−Cu//LFP and Li−Ag@Cu//LFP full cells with a load of 0.4 mAh cm−2 LFP, at 0. C for initial three cycles, followed by five cycles at 1, 2, 3, 4 to 5 C and then back to 1 C between 2.0 and 4. V at room temperature.

an area capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 , denoted as Li−Cu and Li− Ag@Cu, respectively. The cyclic stability of the resulting Li-lean anodes was first evaluated with chronopotentiometry in symmetric cells. The obtained results are presented in [Figure](#page-4-0) 5.

As expected, the cell with Li−Cu anode shows poor cyclic stability, presenting a significantly increased polarization after cycling for 60 h under a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and an area capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 h, and occasionally short circuit Figure 8. Long-term cyclic stability of Li–Cu//LFP and Li–Ag@Cu//LFP full cells with a load of 1 mAh cm $^{-2}$  LFP, at 0. C for initial three cycles, followed by (a) 1 C and (b) 2 C between 2.0 and 4. V at room temperature.

phenomena after further cycling (Figure 5a). Even under lower current density (0.5 mA cm-2, 0.5 mAh cm-2), the Li-Cu anode cannot endure long cycling (Figure 5b). This poor cyclic stability can be ascribed to the low lithiophilicity of Cu, which causes uneven Li depositing/stripping, favors Li dendrite growth, and accelerates the reduction decomposition of electrolyte components. In contrast, the cell with Li-Ag@ Cu anode shows excellent cyclic stability, presenting no significantly increased polarization after cycling for 100 h under 1 mA cm-2 and 1 mAh cm-2 (Figure 5a), and for 320 h under 0.5 mA cm-2 and 0.5 mAh cm-2 (Figure 5b). Furthermore, the cell with Li-Ag@Cu anode keeps lower polarization than the cell with Li-Cu anode (Figure 5c,d). This performance of Li-Ag@Cu anode is comparable with that of a pure Li anode that presents a large initial polarization due to the presence of passivated layer on Li foil (Figure S6), which should be attributed to the low Li deposition overpotential of Ag and the 3D Ag plume structure that provides a large surface area for Li depositing/stripping and large space for alleviating the volume change of anode during cycling. It can be noted from Figure 5 that the voltage-time curves of Li-Cu culls are not symmetrical. This is because the uneven Li deposition on bare Cu and Li might cause the different surface between two electrodes of the cells, which can be avoided by using Ag@Cu as substrate.

Then, the cyclic stability of the resulting Li-lean anodes was evaluated in full cells with LFP as cathode. The obtained results are presented in Figures 6 and 7. Figure 6 presents the performances of the cells with 0.4 mAh cm-2 LFP. As shown in Figure 6a, Li-Ag@Cu//LFP cell shows far better cyclic stability than Li-Cu//LFP cell. After 300 cycles at 1 C, the Li-Ag@Cu//LFP cell still delivers a reversible capacity of 124.5 mAh g-1, with a capacity retention of 81%, while the Li-Cu//LFP cell presents a far capacity decay from the 150th cycle and delivers a reversible capacity of only 13.1 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention of only 9% after 300 cycles. The cyclic stability of the Li-Ag@Cu anode evaluated in full cell is also comparable with that of the pure Li anode, as shown in Figure S7. This excellent performance of Li-Ag@Cu//LFP cell is fulfilled with a negative/positive active material ratio of 25, which outperforms the full cells based on the Li-lean anodes reported in the literature. The charge/discharge profiles in Figure 6b,c demonstrate that the Li-Ag@Cu//LFP cell exhibits less polarization than the Li-Cu//LFP cell, which is well in agreement with the cyclic performances obtained with symmetrical cells. The Ag plumes reduce the Li deposition overpotential of Cu, accelerating Li depositing/stripping kinetics on Cu, 59 which can be confirmed by the lower interface resistance of the cell with Li–Ag@Cu anode than that of the cell with Li–Cu anode in Figure 6d,e. This feature favors the capacity delivery of the cells at high rates. Figure 7 compares the rate capability of the cells with Li–Cu and Li–Ag@Cu anodes. The Li–Ag@Cu/LFP cell delivers 156.5, 145.4, 132.8, 121.5, 113.4, and 106.4 mAh g-1, but only 148.5, 136.3, 121.3, 108.5, 97.8, and 88.8 mAh g-1 for the Li–Cu//LFP cell at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 C, respectively, indicative of the better rate capability of Li–Ag@Cu//LFP cell than Li–Cu//LFP cell. Correspondingly, the Li–Ag@Cu//LFP cell presents less polarization than Li–Cu//LFP cell (Figure.S8).

The as-prepared Li-Ag@Cu anode can maintain its excellent cyclic stability in full cells even using a higher LFP loading. Figure 8 compares the cyclic stability of Li-Cu//LFP and Li-Ag@Cu//LFP full cells with 1 mAh cm-2 LFP. The Li-Cu//LFP full cells show a fast capacity drop during cycling, with a capacity retention of only 13% at 1 C (Figure 8a) and 47% at 2 C (Figure 8b) after 80 cycles. In contrast, the Li-Ag@Cu//LFP full cell shows a significantly improved cyclic stability, with a capacity retention rate of 89% at 1 C and 94% at 2C after 80 cycles.

#### 4. CONCLUSION

We have successfully constructed a 3D Ag plume structure on Cu by immersing Cu foil in an AgF-containing aqueous solution and developed a Li-lean anode by depositing Li on the grown Ag plumes. The 3D Ag plume structure has been confirmed by SEM and TEM characterizations. Whether evaluated in symmetric or full cells, the as-developed Li-lean anode presents excellent cyclic stability. The full cell with an as-developed anode of 10 mAh cm-2 Li and a cathode of 0.4 mAh cm-2 LiFePO4 delivers a reversible capacity of 124.5 mAh g-1after 300 cycles at 1 C, compared to only 13.1 mAh g-1 of the cell using Cu anode with the same deposited Li under the same cell configuration and cycling conditions. This excellent performance of the as-prepared Li-lean anode outperforms those that have been reported in literature, which should be attributed to the low Li deposition overpotential of Ag and the 3D Ag plume structure that provides large surface area for Li/ depositing/stripping and large space for alleviating the volume change of anode during cycling. Since its preparation is facile and easy to scale up, the as-developed anode is promising for the practical application of lithium-metal batteries.
